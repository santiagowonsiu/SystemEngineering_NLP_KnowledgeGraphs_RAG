    "Overall Instructions": {
        "Instructions": "1. Identify the Key Elements: For each requirement, identify key terms and elements as specified in the checklist prompt. Any grammatical object, subject, or adverbial (including manner, place, time, etc.) added or reviewed must be enclosed in brackets [ ] or use 'TBD/TBR'.\n2. Assess Based on Criteria: Use the provided instructions to assess whether the requirement meets the criteria. Any grammatical object, subject, or adverbial (including manner, place, time, etc.) added or reviewed must be enclosed in brackets [ ] or use 'TBD/TBR'.\n3. Inference: Based on the assessment, provide the inference statement indicating PASSED or NOT PASSED, along with the specific reasoning. Any grammatical object, subject, or adverbial (including manner, place, time, etc.) added or reviewed must be enclosed in brackets [ ] or use 'TBD/TBR'.\n4. Recommendation: If the requirement does not pass, provide a recommendation on how it could be rewritten to PASS. Any grammatical object, subject, or adverbial (including manner, place, time, etc.) added or reviewed must be enclosed in brackets [ ] or use 'TBD/TBR'.\n5. Provide a corrected version of the requirement based on the recommendation if it does not pass. Use placeholders such as '[insert value here]' or 'TBD/TBR' to avoid specifying exact values. Any grammatical object, subject, or adverbial (including manner, place, time, etc.) added or reviewed must be enclosed in brackets [ ] or use 'TBD/TBR'."
